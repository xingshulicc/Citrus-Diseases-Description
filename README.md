Description of 6 citrus diseases

Citrus Canker

Symptoms and Impact:
Plants infected with citrus canker have characteristic lesions on leaves, stems, and fruit with raised, brown, water-soaked margins, usually with a yellow halo or ring effect around the lesion. Older lesions have a corky appearance, still in many cases retaining the halo effect. Citrus canker significantly affects the vitality of citrus trees, causing leaves and fruit to drop prematurely; a fruit infected with canker is safe to eat, but too unsightly to be sold. 

Citrus Scab

Symptoms and Impact:
Citrus scab attacks the fruit, leaves, and twigs, producing slightly raised, irregular scabby or wart-like outgrowths. The scabs are grey or pinkish at first and become darker with age. Scabs lesions are present particularly on the young growth. Severely infected fruits are scarred and distorted and consequently unmarketable.

Citrus Leafminer

Symptoms and Impact:
They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine consists of a long epidermal corridor with a well-marked central frass line. The mine is mostly lower-surface, but sometimes upper-surface, and rarely on the rind of the developing fruit. citrus leafminer creates openings that allow for entry of citrus bacterial canker into the tree resulting in infection.

Sooty mold

Symptoms and Impact:


Citrus Anthracnose

Citrus Melanose
