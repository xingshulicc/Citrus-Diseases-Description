Description of 6 citrus diseases

Citrus Canker

Symptoms and Impact:
Plants infected with citrus canker have characteristic lesions on leaves, stems, and fruit with raised, brown, water-soaked margins, usually with a yellow halo or ring effect around the lesion. Older lesions have a corky appearance, still in many cases retaining the halo effect. Citrus canker significantly affects the vitality of citrus trees, causing leaves and fruit to drop prematurely; a fruit infected with canker is safe to eat, but too unsightly to be sold. 

Citrus Scab

Symptoms and Impact:
Citrus scab attacks the fruit, leaves, and twigs, producing slightly raised, irregular scabby or wart-like outgrowths. The scabs are grey or pinkish at first and become darker with age. Scabs lesions are present particularly on the young growth. Severely infected fruits are scarred and distorted and consequently unmarketable.

Citrus Leafminer

Symptoms and Impact:
They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine consists of a long epidermal corridor with a well-marked central frass line. The mine is mostly lower-surface, but sometimes upper-surface, and rarely on the rind of the developing fruit. citrus leafminer creates openings that allow for entry of citrus bacterial canker into the tree resulting in infection.

Sooty mold

Symptoms and Impact:
Sooty mold arrive as a secondary infestation which feeds on the honeydew defecated by insects. Plants become blackened and are usually sticky. The fungi involved are saprophytic, ie. they do not invade the plant tissues, but remain on the surface. The mold is difficult to remove and although it is not feeding on the plant, it restricts the light reaching the leaves, thus reducing photosynthesis. The initial cause is usually a sap-sucking insect like Aphids or Scale Insects. 

Citrus Anthracnose

Symptoms and Impact:
Leaves display more or less circular spots of light tan color with a prominent purple margin. The center of these spots gradually turn grayish and, in the later phases of the infection, it may show tiny dispersed black flecks. Fruit symptoms are firm and dry, brown to black spots of 1.5 mm or slightly greater diameter. The impact of anthracnose on citrus include twig dieback, premature leaf drop, dark staining on fruit and postharvest fruit decay. 

Citrus Melanose

Symptoms and Impact:
Symptoms on foliage begin as tiny water-soaked specks that become depressed in the center and surrounded by a translucent yellow area which is not depressed. Later, the leaf cuticle ruptures and a gummy substance is exuded which turns brown and hardens. The yellowish margin disappears and the hardened gummed areas will have a sandpaper-like texture.  Infected areas on the leaf may be scattered, aggregated, or in streaks, depending on where water transported the inoculums prior to infection.
Fruit symptoms can vary depending on the age of the fruit at the time of infection. Early infections, will show relatively large pustules and when in large numbers they may coalesce to form extensive areas that often crack to produce a pattern described as "mudcake melanose". Infections during later stages of fruit development produce small discrete pustules distributed by spore-laden rain or dew which flows over the fruit surface creating the "tear-stain melanose" pattern.
